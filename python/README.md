==============

Installation is just like any regular Python package:
```sh
pip install .
```

Don't forget you can link-install on your dev machine with
```sh
pip install -e .
```
which means that you don't have to re-install every time you make a code change.

To install the utilities required to run the tests
```sh
pip install -e .[test]
```
